# In-Link: Displaying Tumblr Related Content #
This widget allows you to display related posts within your Tumblr Theme based on current post's tags. A feature that Tumblr is natively missing, and that other services (such as LinkWithin) are unable to provide.
This way you can help your visitors to further discover your contents and enhance their browsing experience.
