# Styling #

The widget comes with 4 different styles options. Or you can always choose to style the widget with your own css theme. In the latter case, simply omit the css= option.

The available styles are as follows:

## Simple Style ##

Select it with the following code: **css=simple**. In this case the widget will output a simple bullet list of the related posts links. Most of the styling here is left to your own template.

## Complete Style ##

Also in this case a list will be rendered, but an icon will indicate the post type. Select it with the following code: **css=complete**.

## Dark Style ##

Select with the following code: **css=dark**. Is useful if you’re using a white or very light background. The widget will output the image thumbnail if the content is a photo, or a Tumblr Post icon for all other post types, rendering a sort of table style.

## Light Style ##

Same as above, only for a darker background. In this case the option should be **css=light**.

## Shadow Style (only for version 2.0) ##

This style is especially useful for rich photography site, and is based on the creation of “clipped” thumbnails. Works at its best with image size set to 250 (so set size=250) as it will create a better “clipping”. Set this option for usage **css=shadow**.
